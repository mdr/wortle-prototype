            Wortle is a daily wild plant identification quiz for plants in Britain and Ireland. Each day, you're
            presented with photographs of a plant growing in the wild and challenged to identify it by its common or
            scientific name. If you're familiar with Wordle - this is similar, but for plant ID! Everyone gets the same
            puzzle every day.
